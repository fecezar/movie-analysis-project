Your team is charged with doing data analysis and creating a presentation that explores what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office.

Based on the data available, the top 5 averaging film genres were Adventure, War, Musical, Fantasy and Family. Interestingly, Adventure films tend to average more than twice as much profit to Thriller, Animation and Documentary. The average of profit was taken to account for the number of films produced in each genre. We assumed that the mean would be the most reliable average with the data we had, and another assumption was that films have a single genre."

In the data below, we have shown a comparison of top 1%/10%/Rest of these job roles effect on average grossing. From the graphs above, it appears directors have the most impact on grossing. The proportion between top 1% and the rest is more skewed for directors than actors, producers, or top movies. Saying that, the results of all 3 are similar."
